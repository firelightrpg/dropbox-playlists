# Dropbox Playlist Generator

## Overview
This script scans a local directory for MP3 files, generates Dropbox shared links, and creates a master CSV playlist. It efficiently updates the playlist by adding new files and removing missing ones while preserving existing entries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dropbox API access token
- Mutagen library (`pip install mutagen`)
- dotenv library (`pip install python-dotenv`)

### Easy Method with a virtual environment (recommended!)
```bash
cd <workspace>
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. Add the following environment variables **OR** Create a `.env` file in the same directory with the following:
   ```env
   DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_dropbox_token
   DROPBOX_ROOT_FOLDER=/path/to/your/dropbox/folder
   LOCAL_ROOT_FOLDER=/path/to/your/local/mp3/folder
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script:
```sh
python -m abovevtt_playlist_db
```

## How It Works
- Loads the existing playlist directory (`playlist_directory.json`) if available.
- Scans for `.mp3` files in the <LOCAL_ROOT_FOLDER> directory.
- Compares with the playlist directory:
  - **New files** are processed and added.
  - **Missing files** are removed from the directory.
  - **Existing files** remain unchanged.
- Creates a `playlist.csv` for import into AboveVTT with the latest changes.

## Managing AboveVTT Audio
AboveVTT does **not** have a "clear" function for audio. If you remove a file from your dropbox, it will **still** appear in AboveVTT until manually deleted. The audio list is stored in the browser cache, so:
1. Use **Export JSON** in AboveVTT to back up your track list.
2. If necessary, clear the AboveVTT audio storage:
   - Open the browser console (`F12` in most browsers).
   - Run:
     ```js
     localStorage.removeItem('audio.library.track')
     ```
   - Refresh AboveVTT.
3. Re-import the updated `playlist.csv` in AboveVTT.

## Notes
- This script does **not** modify existing Dropbox files, only gets or creates their shared links.
- If your Dropbox token expires, regenerate it and update `.env`.
  - This usually only lasts a couple of hours...
- This depends on audio being in a shared dropbox folder. Otherwise, the links will only work for you.

## Troubleshooting
### Missing Shared Links
If a shared link isn't found:
- Ensure the file exists in your Dropbox folder.
- Manually generate a shared link and re-run the script.

### Playlist Not Updating
- Ensure the script has **write permissions** to `playlist.csv`.
- Check the logs for errors (`log.txt` if enabled).
- When in doubt, delete the `playlist_directory.json` file. It will get regenerated, but will take some time to grab
all the links from dropbox, especially if you have a large library!
